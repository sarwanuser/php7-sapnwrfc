This is a rewrite of Piers Harding's [php-sapnwrfc](https://github.com/piersharding/php-sapnwrfc) extension for PHP 5 to make it work with PHP 7.
The original code is for the PHP 5 extension is `Copyright (c) 2010 Piers Harding`

This rewrite - though completely rewritten for PHP 7 - would not be possible without his work on the original extension.

Another great source of help was [node-rfc](https://github.com/SAP/node-rfc) - escpecially when it came to handling the UTF-8 <-> UTF-16 conversion.
